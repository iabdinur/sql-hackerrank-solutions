/* Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P@  and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

+-------------+--------------+
| Field       | Type         |
+-------------+--------------+
| ID          | NUMBER       |
| NAME        | VARCHAR2(21) |
| STATE       | VARCHAR2(2)  |
| LAT_N       | NUMBER       |
| LONG_W      | NUMBER       |
+-------------+--------------+

Where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
*/

select round(abs(max(lat_n) - min(lat_n)) + abs(max(long_w) - min(long_w)),4)
